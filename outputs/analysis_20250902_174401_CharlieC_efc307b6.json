We’re deepening our support for enterprises with new features that are useful for both large businesses and any developers who are scaling quickly on our platform. ## Enhanced enterprise-grade security We’ve introduced Private Link, a new way that customers can ensure direct communication between Azure and OpenAI while minimizing exposure to the open internet. We’ve also released native [Multi-Factor Authentication⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7967234-enabling-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-with-openai) (MFA) to help ensure compliance with increasing access control requirements. These are new additions to our existing stack of [enterprise security features⁠(opens in a new window)](https://trust.openai.com/) including SOC 2 Type II certification, single sign-on (SSO), data encryption at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.2, and role-based access controls. We also offer [Business Associate Agreements⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8660679-how-can-i-get-a-business-associate-agreement-baa-with-openai) for healthcare companies that require HIPAA compliance and a zero data retention policy for API customers with a qualifying use case. ## Better administrative control With our new [Projects⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755) feature, organizations will have more granular control and oversight over individual projects in OpenAI. This includes the ability to scope roles and API keys to specific projects, restrict/allow which models to make available, and set usage- and rate-based limits to give access and avoid unexpected overages. Project owners will also have the ability to create service account API keys, which give access to projects without being tied to an individual user. ![More Enterprise Grade Features Product Demo-1](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/2DzJcEhUQrr55NQuqm5sn/86c12f693859ffc8496559ce0ed5f5bb/projects-crop-2.gif?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp) ## Assistants API improvements We’ve introduced several updates to the Assistants API for more accurate retrieval, flexibility around model behavior and tools used to complete tasks, and better control over costs. These features include: - Improved retrieval with ‘file\\_search’ which can ingest up to 10,000 files per assistant—a 500x increase from the previous file limit of 20. The tool is faster, supports parallel queries through multi-threaded searches, and has enhanced reranking and query rewriting. - Streaming support for real-time, conversational responses—one of the top requests from developers and enterprises. New ‘vector\\_store’ objects in the API so files can be added to a vector store and automatically parsed, chunked, and embedded in preparation for file search. Vector stores can be used across assistants and threads, simplifying file management and billing. - Control over the maximum number of tokens used per run, plus limits on previous and recent messages used in each run, so you can manage token usage costs. New ‘tool\\_choice’ parameter to select a specific tool (like ‘file\\_search’, ‘code\\_interpreter’, or ‘function’) in a particular run. - Support for fine-tuned GPT‑3.5 Turbo models in the API (to start, we’ll support fine-tunes of ‘gpt-3.5-turbo-0125’). ![More Enterprise Grade Features Product Demo-2](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/4ciXL2zuaVHJSE9UV3O7ks/9e25f52db2bb3f53931af765ae4f020f/sArea46.gif?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp) ## More options for cost management To help organizations scale their AI usage without over-extending their budgets, we’ve added two new ways to reduce costs on consistent and asynchronous workloads: - **Discounted usage on committed throughput:** Customers with a sustained level of tokens per minute (TPM) usage on GPT‑4 or GPT‑4 Turbo can request access to provisioned throughput to get discounts ranging from 10–50% based on the size of the commitment. - **Reduced costs on asynchronous workloads:** Customers can use our new [Batch API⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch) to run non-urgent workloads asynchronously. Batch API requests are priced at 50% off shared prices, offer much higher rate limits, and return results within 24 hours. This is ideal for use cases like model evaluation, offline classification, summarization, and synthetic data generation. We plan to keep adding new features focused on enterprise-grade security, administrative controls, and cost management.

We heard from customers this name was clearer. Features and pricing haven’t changed._ We launched ChatGPT Enterprise a few months ago and industry leaders like Block, Canva, Carlyle, The Estée Lauder Companies, PwC, and Zapier are already using it to redefine how their organizations operate. Today, we’re adding a new self-serve plan: [ChatGPT Team](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team/). ChatGPT Team offers access to our advanced models like GPT‑4 and DALL·E 3, and tools like Advanced Data Analysis. It additionally includes a dedicated collaborative workspace for your team and admin tools for team management. As with ChatGPT Enterprise, you own and control your business data—we do not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage. More details on our data privacy practices can be found on our [privacy page⁠](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/) and [Trust Portal⁠(opens in a new window)](https://trust.openai.com/). ![ChatGPT Team](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/cc305f9e-cb40-426f-d739d4539ebd/82b76fda7f5dd5e85e35f610987a6cf9/team-hero-for-blog.jpg?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp) **ChatGPT Team includes**: - Access to GPT‑4 with 32K context window - Tools like DALL·E 3, GPT‑4 with Vision, Browsing, Advanced Data Analysis—with higher message caps - No training on your business data or conversations - Secure workspace for your team - Create and share custom GPTs with your workspace - Admin console for workspace and team management - Early access to new features and improvements - [Start now(opens in a new window)](https://chatgpt.com/?openaicom-did=b47be2b6-e6fa-4e9b-8bb3-3667f51ca314&openaicom_referred=true#pricing) ## Customize ChatGPT for any type of work We recently [announced GPTs⁠](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/)—custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose with instructions, expanded knowledge, and custom capabilities. These can be especially useful for businesses and teams. With GPTs, you can customize ChatGPT to your team’s specific needs and workflows (no code required) and publish them securely to your team’s workspace. GPTs can help with a wide range of tasks, such as assisting in project management, team onboarding, generating code, performing data analysis, securely taking action in your existing systems and tools, or creating collateral to match your brand tone and voice. Today, we announced the [GPT Store⁠(opens in a new window)](http://chat.openai.com/gpts) where you can find useful and popular GPTs from your workspace. ## Improve team efficiency and work quality Integrating AI into everyday organizational workflows can make your team more productive. In a recent study by the Harvard Business School, employees at Boston Consulting Group who were given access to GPT‑4 reported completing tasks 25% faster and achieved a 40% higher quality in their work as compared to their peers who did not have access.[1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-team/#citation-bottom-1) Connor O’Brien, VP of GTM Strategy & Operations at Sourcegraph, shares, \"We use ChatGPT in almost every part of our business, from financial modeling for pricing and packaging to internal and external communications to board prep to recruiting and note taking—it’s accelerated everything we do allowing us to execute at a high level.\" Dr. John Brownstein, Chief Innovation Officer at Boston Children’s Hospital says, “With ChatGPT Team, we’ve been able to pilot innovative GPTs that enhance our team’s productivity and collaboration. As we integrate GPTs safely and responsibly across internal operations, we know the transformative impact this will have in strengthening the systems that enable our doctors, researchers, students, and administrative staff to provide exceptional care to every patient that walks through our doors.” ChatGPT Team costs $25/month per user when billed annually, or $30/month per user when billed monthly.

Since the launch of our API, we’ve made deploying applications faster and more streamlined while adding new safety features. Our progress with safeguards makes it possible to remove the waitlist for GPT‑3. Starting today, developers in [supported countries⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/supported-countries) can [sign up⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/signup) and start experimenting with our API right away. Improvements to our API over the past year include the [Instruct Series⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/instruct-series-beta) models that adhere better to human instructions, specialized endpoints for more truthful [question-answering⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers), and a free [content filter⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/content-filter) to help developers mitigate abuse. Our work also allows us to review applications before they [go live⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/going-live), monitor for misuse, support developers as their product scales, and better [understand the effects⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/safety-best-practices/understanding-safety-risks) of this technology. Other changes include an improved Playground, which makes it easy to prototype with our models, an [example library⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/examples) with dozens of prompts to get developers started, and [Codex⁠](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/), a new model that translates natural language into code. Tens of thousands of developers are already taking advantage of powerful AI models through our platform. We believe that by opening access to these models via an easy-to-use API, more developers will find creative ways to apply AI to a large number of useful applications and open problems. To ensure API-backed applications are built responsibly, we provide [tools⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/content-filter) and help developers use [best practices⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/safety-best-practices) so they can bring their applications to production quickly and safely. As our systems evolve and we work to improve the capabilities of our safeguards, we expect to continue streamlining the process for developers, refining our [usage guidelines⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines), and allowing even more use cases over time. As another step in this direction, we are also updating our [content guidelines⁠(opens in a new window)](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-guidelines) to clarify what kind of content our API can be used to generate. Our policies have always prohibited the use of our API in ways that do not adhere to the principles described in our [Charter⁠](https://openai.com/charter/), and content like hate speech remains prohibited. To help developers ensure their applications are used for their intended purpose, prevent potential misuse, and adhere to our content guidelines, we offer developers a free content filter. We are currently testing targeted filters for specific content categories with some customers. We are also prohibiting certain types of content on our API, like adult content, where our system is not currently able to reliably discern harmful from acceptable use. We are continually working to make our content filters more robust and we intend to allow acceptable use within some categories as our system improves. We’re excited to have the safeguards in place to open up GPT‑3 for more developers. As our safeguards continue to improve, we will expand how the API can be used while further improving the experience for our users.

Today, we’re introducing Prompt Caching, allowing developers to reduce costs and latency. By reusing recently seen input tokens, developers can get a 50% discount and faster prompt processing times. ## Prompt Caching Availability & Pricing Starting today, Prompt Caching is automatically applied on the latest versions of GPT‑4o, GPT‑4o mini, o1‑preview and o1‑mini, as well as fine-tuned versions of those models. Cached prompts are offered at a discount compared to uncached prompts. Here's an overview of pricing: | | **Uncached Input Tokens** | **Cached Input Tokens** | **Output Tokens** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **GPT‑4o** | | | | | gpt-4o-2024-08-06 | $2.50 | $1.25 | $10.00 | | GPT‑4o fine-tuning | $3.75 | $1.875 | $15.00 | | **GPT‑4o mini** | | | | | gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 | $0.15 | $0.075 | $0.60 | | GPT‑4o mini fine-tuning | $0.30 | $0.15 | $1.20 | | **o1** | | | | | o1‑preview | $15.00 | $7.50 | $60.00 | | o1 mini | $3.00 | $1.50 | $12.00 | ## Monitoring Cache Usage API calls to supported models will automatically benefit from Prompt Caching on prompts longer than 1,024 tokens. The API caches the longest prefix of a prompt that has been previously computed, starting at 1,024 tokens and increasing in 128-token increments. If you reuse prompts with common prefixes, we will automatically apply the Prompt Caching discount without requiring you to make any changes to your API integration. Requests using Prompt Caching have a `cached_tokens` value within the `usage` field in the API response: #### JavaScript ` 1 usage: { 2 total_tokens: 2306, 3 prompt_tokens: 2006, 4 completion_tokens: 300, 5 6 prompt_tokens_details: { 7 cached_tokens: 1920, 8 audio_tokens: 0, 9 }, 10 completion_tokens_details: { 11 reasoning_tokens: 0, 12 audio_tokens: 0, 13 } 14 }` Caches are typically cleared after 5-10 minutes of inactivity and are always removed within one hour of the cache's last use. As with all API services, Prompt Caching is subject to our [Enterprise privacy⁠](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/) commitments. Prompt caches are not shared between organizations. Prompt Caching is one of a variety of tools for developers to scale their applications in production while balancing performance, cost and latency.
