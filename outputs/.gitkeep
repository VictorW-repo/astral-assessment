# Output Directory

This directory stores JSON output files from the registration workflow.

Files are named: `analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<request_id>.json`

No database is used - all data is stored as JSON files.

This file ensures the directory is tracked by git while keeping the actual output files ignored (see .gitignore).
